            I am now sending invoices through Square instead of Venmo and PayPal! 
            It will make everyhting easier to keep track of invoices on my end! 
            It will not change much on y'all's end,  but I wanted to take a second to explain for anyone who might have questions!
            <br>
            <br>
            That means that all I will need going forward is your email! 
            The awesome thing about this software is once I enter your email once, I will have it in my system! 
            That means you will not have to commment your email every single comment on lives or posts!
            I'll also be able to tell you each item you got form the live, so you will not be wondering anymore!
            <br>
            <br>
            Invoices will be sent to your email, and it will show from Lola Mae's Boutique! 
            You simply click "Pay Invoice", and it will take you online to pay!

            We have grown so quickly, and I can't tell y'all how thankful I am for the support I have recieved! 
            I truly believe I have the best customers!
            With that being said, our pick up boxes are overflowing! 
            Therefore, I am implementing a pick up policy to help with this!
            It will go into effect starting today!
            <br>
            <br>
            I am now dating the packages when I place them in the pick up bin. 
            You will have 30 days, arrangements will need to be made with me to place the item back in the bin. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Please give a 24 hour notice.
            I can also ship the items if needed!
            After 90 days, your purchase will be considered a donation to the YoungLives program in Jackson,TN.
            This program helps teen mothers in the surrounding areas while also sharing the gospel.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thank youu all for understanding! 
            Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if there are extenuating circumstances! 
            I know life happens, and I am more than happy to work with you guys!
